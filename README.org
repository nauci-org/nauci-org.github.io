* Nauci Landing Page
This repository contains the static landing page for the Nauci monitoring platform, hosted at https://nauci.org.

Nauci is a lightweight tool for monitoring ETL pipelines and ML inference systems. It is designed to be simple, affordable, and easy to set up, especially for solo developers, small teams, and early-stage startups.

* Project Status
This is an early-stage indie project. I'm building this solo and iterating in public. Feedback and encouragement are welcome!
